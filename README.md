# FWI
Acoustic Full-waveform inversion (FWI) for isotropic media, where the wave equation is solved in the frequency domain with perfectly mathced layers (PML) and absorbing boundary condition (ABC) by finite difference method.
For more details, please read 'Acoustic FWI in the frequency domain.pdf'.\
The toy velocity model is stolen from the course TPG4155 at NTNU.
